<br>
In an era where circular fashion is more than a trend, the second-hand market has transformed from a niche pastime into a global force of style and sustainability. Digital resale platforms are rewriting the fashion playbook, and our study just confirmed what the most successful resellers have long suspected: **popularity sells**.
 
Yes, the humble *like*, a digital nod of approval, is now the strongest indicator of whether your pre-loved item will find a new home.

## The Study
<br>
We analyzed over **560,000 items** from more than **360,000 users**, focusing on men’s and women’s clothing. The results? Not what you’d expect.
 
Brand names, often held up as the holy grail of resale, turned out to be surprisingly weak predictors of actual sales. One reason? Human error. Among the top “brands” listed: *Uomo*, not a luxury label, just the Italian word for “man.”
 
Instead, what really moves the virtual shelves is something more elusive: **attention**. Items that rack up *likes* are far more likely to sell. **Visibility**, it turns out, is the X-Factor.

## Insights from the Inside
<br>
Streetwear reseller and influencer **@Majinbux** (Simone Buccioni) summed it up best:

<div style="background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #00b39f; border-radius: 4px; margin-top: 1rem;">
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
    “Men go for brands.”
  </p>
</div>
<br>
 
But the data tells a deeper story, that beyond the brand, it’s *social validation* that seals the deal. Being seen, shared, and approved by the community matters more than a designer tag, especially one that might be misspelled.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Words Matter
<br> 
Listings that included descriptions like **“never worn”** or **“in excellent condition”** outperformed the rest. Buyers, it seems, want second-hand with **first-wear freshness**. The allure lies in the *newness of the nearly new*.

<br>

<br>

## Pics Don't Matter
<br>
Despite the visual-centric nature of fashion, our findings show that **images alone are not reliable predictors of sales**. The verdict? **In second-hand fashion, social cues speak louder than aesthetics.**

## When Data Gets Dressed
<br>
We didn’t stop at observation: we tried to **predict the future**. Using machine learning, we built models to guess which items would sell and why.
The result? Likes are still among the best indicators, but category and timing matter just as much. Turns out, attention isn’t just powerful, it’s predictable.

<br>
<br>

## Closing Look
<br> 
What emerged from the numbers was more than just patterns — it was a **cultural insight**: in today’s fashion economy, **social proof is the new luxury label**.
 
The key to resale success? It’s not just what you’re selling — it’s how many people are watching.

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
    So next time you list that barely-worn coat, don’t just drop the brand name. <strong>Make it likeable.</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="margin: 0;">
    Because in the fashion marketplace of the future, <strong>popularity isn’t just a metric, it’s currency.</strong>
