## Dataset Collection

We adopted a two-phase web scraping approach:

### Phase 1 (April 15 â€“ June 30)
> Daily collection of new listings including product metadata

### Phase 2 (July 7)
> Status check for previously scraped items (sold, available or missing)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

As of July 7, we had collected:

- **Over 700,000 instances of items**
- **560,770 unique items**  
- **Around 360,000 users**  
- **251,070 sold items** (~30% sold rate)

This dataset enabled us to estimate the **probability of sale** and analyze the influence of item features on the resale outcome.
