# Like 2 Resell: Why Popularity, Rules the Second-Hand Fashion Market

![Banner images](assets/images/home/griglia_immagini_home.png)

In an era where circular fashion is more than a trend — it’s a movement — the second-hand market has transformed from a niche pastime into a global force of style and sustainability. Digital resale platforms are rewriting the fashion playbook, and a new study just confirmed what the most successful resellers have long suspected: **popularity sells**.
 
Yes, the humble *like* — a digital nod of approval — is now the strongest indicator of whether your pre-loved item will find a new home.

## The Study
 
Researchers analyzed over **560,000 listings** and data from more than **360,000 users**, focusing on men’s and women’s apparel and footwear. The results? Not what you’d expect.
 
Brand names — often held up as the holy grail of resale — turned out to be surprisingly weak predictors of actual sales. One reason? Human error. Among the top “brands” listed: *Uomo* — not a luxury label, just the Italian word for “man.”
 
Instead, what really moves the virtual racks is something more elusive: **attention**. Items that rack up *likes* are far more likely to sell, regardless of their logo, price, or even condition. **Visibility**, it turns out, **trumps pedigree**.

## Insights from the Inside
 
Streetwear reseller and influencer **@Majinbux** (Simone Buccioni) summed it up best:
 
> “Men go for brands.”
 
But the data tells a deeper story — that beyond the brand, it’s *social validation* that seals the deal. Being seen, shared, and approved by the community matters more than a designer tag, especially one that might be misspelled.

## Words Matter
 
Listings that included descriptions like **“never worn”** or **“in excellent condition”** dramatically outperformed the rest. Buyers, it seems, want second-hand with **first-wear freshness**. The allure lies in the *newness of the nearly new*.

## The Project
 
The study aimed to decode the behavior of digital second-hand sellers. Using web scraping techniques, researchers collected data on:
 
- Price  
- Label  
- Size  
- Condition  
- Category  
- Description  
- Upload date  
- Number of likes  
- Seller’s location (when available)  
 
The goal? To create a structured dataset that could reveal the hidden mechanics of resale success.

## Conclusion
 
What emerged from the numbers was more than just patterns — it was a **cultural insight**: in today’s fashion economy, **social proof is the new luxury label**.
 
The key to resale success? It’s not just what you’re selling — it’s how many people are watching.
 
So next time you list that barely-worn coat, don’t just drop the brand name. **Make it likeable**. Because in the fashion marketplace of the future, **popularity isn’t just a metric — it’s currency**.
