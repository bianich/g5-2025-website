## Abstract

The rise of the second-hand online market in a world increasingly focused on sustainability and circular fashion, specialized platforms are reshaping the way we buy and sell clothes.

Our research shows a **clear result**:  
**Likes are a crucial predictor of whether an item will be sold.**

To investigate this, we collected over **560,000 product listings** and data on **more than 360,000 users**, focusing on the men’s and women’s clothing and footwear categories. This project was born to understand the dynamics of the second-hand market, identify selling strategies, pricing trends, and the spatial-temporal distribution of used items.

## Project Overview

With this project, the aim is to explore the behavior of users selling second-hand items online. Using web scraping techniques, we gathered information on:

- Price  
- Label  
- Size  
- Condition  
- Category  
- Description  
- Upload date  
- Number of likes  
- Seller’s location (when available)

Our goal was to create a clean, structured dataset to analyze patterns of interaction and predict factors contributing to successful resale.

## Dataset Collection

We adopted a two-phase web scraping approach:

### Phase 1 (April 15 – June 30)
> Daily collection of new listings including product metadata

### Phase 2 (July 7)
> Status check for previously scraped items (sold, available or missing)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

As of July 7, we had collected:

- **Over 700,000 instances of items**
- **560,770 unique items**  
- **Around 360,000 users**  
- **251,070 sold items** (~30% sold rate)

This dataset enabled us to estimate the **probability of sale** and analyze the influence of item features on the resale outcome.
